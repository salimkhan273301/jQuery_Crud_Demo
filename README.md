# jQuery_Crud_Demo
CRUD Operations with Spring Boot, JPA, SQLite, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX
This is a simple application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring Boot, JPA, SQLite, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX. The application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a database.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: A framework for creating Java applications quickly and easily.
JPA (Java Persistence API): A specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and relational databases.
SQLite: A lightweight, serverless database engine that stores data in a single file.
HTML: A markup language used for creating web pages.
CSS: A stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.
jQuery: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): A technique that allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Open the project in your preferred IDE.

Build and run the application.

Access the application in your web browser using the following URL:

Functionality
The application provides a user interface that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a database of items. The following functionality is available:

Create: Users can add new items to the database by filling out a form and submitting it.
Read: Users can view a list of all items in the database.
Update: Users can edit the details of an existing item by selecting it from the list and updating the form fields.
Delete: Users can remove an item from the database by selecting it from the list and clicking the delete button.

Project Structure
The project follows a typical Spring Boot project structure with the following key components:

Controller: Contains the API endpoints that handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate the processing to the service layer.
Service: Implements the business logic and communicates with the repository layer.
Repository: Interacts with the database using JPA and provides methods for performing CRUD operations.
POJO (Plain Old Java Object) Class: Represents the data model and is used to map the database entities.
HTML/CSS: Defines the user interface and layout of the application.
jQuery: Handles the client-side functionality and AJAX requests to communicate with the server.


Conclusion
This application demonstrates the basic implementation of CRUD operations using Spring Boot, JPA, SQLite, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX. You can use this project as a starting point for building more complex applications or as a learning resource to understand the fundamentals of these technologies. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements. Happy coding!
